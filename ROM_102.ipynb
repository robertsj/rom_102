    "As an example application, consider the conduction of heat in a nuclear reactor fuel element.  A fuel element is typically a long cylinder ($L=3$ m; $D = 0.9$cm) made of ceramic UO$_2$ fuel enclosed in a thin ($\\Delta = 0.1$ cm) metallic sheath called the cladding.  Often, there is a small gap between the fuel and the cladding filled with an inert gas like argon.  Reactions from fission in the fuel leads to local heating, and, given the volumetric fission rate $f(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, the heat generation rate is $q''' = \\kappa f$ where $\\kappa$ is a conversion factor. These fuel elements are most often assembled in relatively tight ($1.2$ cm center-to-center), vertical clusters cooled by forced flow of water through the channels formed by the exterior of the cladding."
